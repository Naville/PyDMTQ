# PyDMTQ
  Python Implementation for DJMax Technika Q's API obtained from reverse engineering the android version of the game.
# Usage
  Just provide login details during construction of a `PyDMTQ` object. Currently only UDID based login has been tested. You can obtain your UDID from doing a web capture or dumping the system keychain on a jailbroken iOS device.
  From there you can use crawlers to mirror the official server or fake scores to pass a mission in order to get free Q Point as a reward.
